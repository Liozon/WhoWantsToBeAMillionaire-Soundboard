# WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire-Soundboard

This soundboard has all the sounds from the TV game show "Who wants to be a millionaire ?".

This soundboard is forked from the awesome work of [mayurcybercz's Rick Sanchez soundboard](https://github.com/mayurcybercz/RickSanchez-Soundboard "Rick Sanchez soundboard").

This soundboard supports:

* Responsive layout (currently in dev)
* A seekbar for each sound, to know how many time is remaining
* Pause the current sound when pressing on the same sound
* Pause the previous sound before playing the new sound
